In PHP, "OOP" stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It's a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (methods or functions).

Here are some key concepts related to OOP in PHP:

1. **Classes:** A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that objects of the class will have.

2. **Objects:** An object is an instance of a class. It is created using the `new` keyword followed by the class name and can have its own set of properties and methods.

3. **Properties:** Properties, also known as attributes or member variables, are variables that hold data associated with a class or object.

4. **Methods:** Methods, also known as functions or member functions, are functions defined within a class that can be called on objects of that class to perform specific actions.

5. **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It helps in hiding the internal state of an object and only exposing necessary functionality through methods.

6. **Inheritance:** Inheritance is a mechanism in which a class (subclass or child class) inherits properties and methods from another class (superclass or parent class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

7. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables code to work with objects of different types through a uniform interface.

8. **Abstraction:** Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of a class and only exposing the essential features through a simplified interface. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.

## task

### Variables and Constants:
Question: Write a PHP script that declares a constant named `PI` with the value 3.14159. Then, calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5 using this constant and print the result.

### Data Types:
Question: Write a PHP script that prompts the user to enter their name and age. Store the name as a string and age as an integer. Then, display a message with the user's name and age.

### Basic Input/Output:
Question: Write a PHP script that prompts the user to enter two numbers. Then, calculate and display the sum, difference, product, and quotient of these numbers.

### Operators:
Question: Write a PHP script that calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height. Prompt the user to enter the values for base and height, and then calculate and display the area using the formula: Area = (base * height) / 2.

### Control Flow Structures:
Question: Write a PHP script that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. Prompt the user to enter a year, and then display a message indicating whether it's a leap year or not.

### Functions:
Question: Write a PHP function called `isPrime` that takes an integer parameter `n` and returns true if `n` is a prime number, and false otherwise. Then, test this function by checking whether a given number is prime or not.

### Arrays:
Question: Write a PHP script that creates an associative array containing the names and ages of three people. Then, loop through the array and print each person's name and age.
