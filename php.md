1. **PHP Basics:**
   - Variables and constants
   - Data types (int, float, string, boolean, etc.)
   - Basic input/output (echo, print)
   - Operators (arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, etc.)
   - Control flow structures (if statements, loops, etc.)
   - Functions
   - Super global variables ($_GET, $_POST, $_SESSION, $_COOKIE, etc.)
   - Error handling
   - File handling
   - Forms handling
   - Database connectivity (MySQL, PDO, etc.)

2. **Arrays:** Arrays in PHP are versatile and can hold multiple values of different types. They can be indexed or associative.

3. **For Loop:** The for loop in PHP is used to execute a block of code a specified number of times. It typically includes an initialization, a condition, and an increment or decrement expression.

4. **If Statement:** PHP's if statement is used to execute code based on a condition. It can be used alone or in conjunction with else and elseif statements for more complex conditions.

5. **While Loop:** PHP's while loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition evaluates to true. It's useful when you don't know in advance how many times the loop will run.

6. **Switch Statement:** PHP's switch statement provides a way to execute one block of code from multiple options. It's an alternative to using multiple if-else statements.

7. **Nested If Statement:** PHP supports nesting if statements inside one another to handle more complex conditional logic.


## Tasks
### PHP Basics:
Question: Write a PHP script that declares a variable $name and assigns it the value "John Doe". Then, use echo to print the value of $name to the screen.

### Arrays:
Question: Write a PHP script that creates an indexed array containing the days of the week. Print the array elements using a loop.

### For Loop:
Question: Write a PHP script to display the first 10 natural numbers using a for loop.

### If Statement:
Question: Write a PHP script that checks whether a given number is even or odd using an if statement. Print "Even" or "Odd" accordingly.

### While Loop:
Question: Write a PHP script to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms using a while loop.

### Switch Statement:
Question: Write a PHP script that takes a number (1-7) as input and prints the corresponding day of the week using a switch statement.

### Nested If Statement:
Question: Write a PHP script that asks the user to input their age. Then, based on their age, print different messages using nested if statements (e.g., "You're a child", "You're a teenager", "You're an adult").
