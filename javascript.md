# javascript

1. **JavaScript Basics:**
   - Variables and constants
   - Data types (number, string, boolean, null, undefined, object, symbol)
   - Basic input/output (console.log(), alert(), prompt())
   - Operators (arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, etc.)
   - Control flow structures (if statements, loops, etc.)
   - Functions
   - Scope (global scope, function scope, block scope)
   - Objects and object-oriented programming
   - Arrays
   - Error handling (try-catch blocks)
   - DOM manipulation
   - Events and event handling
   - Asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)
   - Modules and module loaders (CommonJS, ES6 modules)

2. **Arrays:** Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic, can hold elements of different types, and can grow or shrink in size dynamically.

3. **For Loop:** JavaScript's for loop is used to iterate over a block of code a specified number of times. It includes initialization, condition, and iteration expressions.

4. **If Statement:** JavaScript's if statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. It can be followed by else and else if clauses for handling multiple conditions.

5. **While Loop:** JavaScript's while loop executes a block of code while a specified condition is true. It continues to execute until the condition becomes false.

6. **Switch Statement:** JavaScript's switch statement provides a way to execute one block of code from multiple options. It's commonly used as an alternative to long if-else chains.

7. **Nested If Statement:** JavaScript supports nesting if statements inside one another to handle more complex conditional logic.

## task

### JavaScript Basics:
Question: Write a JavaScript program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Prompt the user to enter the length and width, then display the result using `alert()`.

### Arrays:
Question: Write a JavaScript program that creates an array of student names. Add a new student to the array, remove the last student, and print the resulting array.

### For Loop:
Question: Write a JavaScript program to generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers using a for loop.

### If Statement:
Question: Write a JavaScript program that prompts the user to enter their age. If the age is greater than or equal to 18, display "You are an adult"; otherwise, display "You are a minor".

### While Loop:
Question: Write a JavaScript program to find the largest number in an array using a while loop.

### Switch Statement:
Question: Write a JavaScript program that prompts the user to enter a month number (1-12). Using a switch statement, display the name of the corresponding month.

### Nested If Statement:
Question: Write a JavaScript program that asks the user to input their grade percentage. Then, based on their grade, print different messages using nested if statements (e.g., "You passed with distinction", "You passed", "You need improvement").
