# C Programming Basics

1. **C Basics:**
   - Data types (int, float, double, char, etc.): Understanding the different types of data that can be used in C programming and their sizes and ranges.
   - Variables and constants: Declaration and usage of variables and constants to store data.
   - Basic input/output (stdio.h library): Reading input from the user and printing output to the screen.
   - Operators (arithmetic, relational, logical, etc.): Understanding and using various operators for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.
   - Control flow structures (if statements, loops, switch statements): Using control flow structures to make decisions and execute code based on conditions.
   - Functions: Creating and calling functions to encapsulate reusable code blocks.
   - Arrays: Declaring and using arrays to store multiple elements of the same data type.
   - Pointers (basic understanding): Understanding the concept of pointers and their basic usage.
   - Memory management (allocation and deallocation): Allocating and deallocating memory dynamically using functions like malloc() and free().
   - Basic error handling: Handling errors and unexpected situations in the code.
   - Preprocessor directives (#include, #define, etc.): Using preprocessor directives to include header files and define constants.

2. **Arrays:**
   - Declaration and initialization of arrays.
   - Accessing array elements.
   - Iterating through arrays.
   - Multi-dimensional arrays.
   - Passing arrays to functions.

3. **For Loop:**
   - Syntax and structure of a for loop.
   - Initializing, condition, and increment/decrement sections.
   - Examples of using for loops for iteration.

4. **If Statement:**
   - Syntax and structure of an if statement.
   - Using if statements for conditional execution.
   - Handling multiple conditions with else if and else clauses.
   - Nested if statements.

5. **While Loop:**
   - Syntax and structure of a while loop.
   - Using while loops for repetitive execution.
   - Exiting loops with break and continue statements.

6. **Switch Statement:**
   - Syntax and structure of a switch statement.
   - Using switch statements for multi-way branching.
   - Handling default cases and break statements.

7. **Nested If Statement:**
   - Using if statements within other if statements for nested conditional execution.
   - Examples of nested if statements for complex decision-making.

## Task:
### C Basics:
Question: Write a C program that asks the user to enter two numbers and then prints their sum.

### Arrays:
Question: Write a C program to find the largest element in an array of integers.

### For Loop:
Question: Write a C program to display the multiplication table of a given number using a for loop.

### If Statement:
Question: Write a C program that reads an integer from the user and prints "Positive" if it's greater than zero, "Negative" if it's less than zero, and "Zero" if it's equal to zero.

### While Loop:
Question: Write a C program to find the factorial of a given number using a while loop.

### Switch Statement:
Question: Write a C program to input a number (1-7) from the user and print the corresponding day of the week using a switch statement.

### Nested If Statement:
Question: Write a C program that reads three numbers from the user and prints the largest number using nested if statements.
